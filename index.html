            Before coming to the USA, I was doing my bachelors in languages with
            focus in English, Portuguese and French. That is when in my junior
            year I decided to come and spend a year to polish my english skills
            and then somehow I am here now in my junior year studying Web
            Design. I started my studies at Seminole State College of Florida,
            taking EAP classes -English for Academic Purposes- where I improved
            my english skills and then I took 2 years to finish my Associate in
            Arts. I knew I wanted to do Web Design but I was not sure until I
            took one programming class, and I ended up here at the University of
            Central Florida.

            I started my junior year at UCF in Fall 2022 in Digital Media Web
            Design, where I have had the opportunity to meet incredible
            professors and classmates. There have been some struggles, but you
            have to climb step by step. I have had my challenges along the way,
            but I am happy doing what I am doing. If things go to the plan, I
            will graduate in Spring 2025, next year I want to do an intership
            in Travel + Leisure which is the world leading membership and
            leisure travel company, with a portfolio of nearly 20 resort, travel
            club, and lifestyle travel brands.
